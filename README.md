# 3d
Experimental way of quick designing a 3D scene with Processing.js. Try it https://tableaunoir.github.io/3d/.

## Features

- **Super easy**. You want to type a line, just type: <code>line(0, 0, 1, 1)</code>. And done! It relies on P5.js, but the verbose environment is hidden.
- **Share the URL** to share your picture.

## Needs
This tool is born because I need a simple tool to share 3D images. This tool might be good for you if:
- you want to quickly program **simple** things in 3D. Tikz makes a lot of errors and produces fixed images. Processing.js (P5.js) is rather simple, so this tool is actually a wrapper on P5.js. The setup() and draw() functions are behind the scene: here we go to the essential.
- you need to quickly share your ideas: here, simply copy-and-paste the URL and share it.
